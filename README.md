An unnecessarily precise clock, just because I felt like making one.
- Synchronizes time from GPS
- Updates at 1000Hz for true millisecond display
- Zero flicker display, with no PWM or multiplexing
- Configured with a web page via Bluetooth Low Energy

Folders:
- **CAD**\
CAD models (Fusion 360), gerbers, 3D printable parts (.3mf), schematics, and PCB layouts
- **docs**\
Configuration web page, which is published to https://amagill.github.io/GPSClock/.  (Only works with Chromium-based browsers, unfortunately.)
- **Logic_TLC5952**\
A simple high level analyzer for Saleae Logic to interpret data for the TLC5952.
